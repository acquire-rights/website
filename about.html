            <p>After studying Commercial Economics, I started in banking. As a sales consultant, I advised small and
              medium-sized companies on banking products, such as insurance. Through my employer – DPA professionals – I
              was seconded to Rabobank Nederland in Tilburg. That was quite a drive from the Achterhoek. Because of the
              travel time, I often stayed overnight in Moergestel.</p>
            <p>I found little challenge in my work as a sales consultant. To get away from it all, I started a
              dropshipping webshop for exclusive rims. Those who know me know that I have had a great passion for
              everything motorized from childhood on. I had no experience whatsoever in coding, online marketing, and
              everything that came with entrepreneurship. However, everything could be found on the Internet and in
              books, so I taught myself.</p>

            <p>As a website owner, of course, you want to be found well. You can have such a good and unique offer, but
              of course, if no one knows how to find you, you have pretty little use for it. Soon I came into contact
              with SEO and SEA. I discovered that through Google Ads you could buy on intentional terms quite easily and
              that this also paid off well. At least, if you know what you’re doing.</p>
            <p>I enjoyed working with SEA so much that I decided to quit my job in banking and take an Online Marketing
              traineeship at a medium-sized agency in the region. This time closer to home. Here I learned the basics of
              my profession in my first year as an Online Marketer.</p>
            <p>A year later, I moved on to a more mature agency in Arnhem. I was diligently looking for seniority. I was
              looking for colleagues who were more advanced in Google Ads. At that time, I was like a sponge. I wanted
              to know everything about Google Ads – all the ins and outs. The webshop? I had already sold it for a good
              price to an entrepreneur in Brabant.</p>

              <p>After 3 years of working at online marketing agencies, I decided to become self-employed. I started
                freelancing in the evenings. It soon became evening hours as well as weekends. Until I could no longer
                combine it with my job. I quit my job and became a full-time entrepreneur.</p>
              <p>I now help a select number of ambitious companies get the most out of Google Ads. Currently, about
                €1,500,000 per month in ad spend passes through my fingers. And I expect this to only increase, given the
                growth my clients experience year on year.</p>
              <p>Over the years I have had the opportunity to work on more than 100 Google Ads accounts. Often challenging
                accounts from great names, including Weight Watchers, Louwman, Profile Tyrecenter, Schoonenberg, and more.
                I was also hired by cool agencies – including Yonego, Brandfirm, and eRocket – to share my knowledge,
                write out work processes and build out the advertising team.</p>
              <p>In addition to the operational work I do for my clients, I develop Google Ads training for the advanced
              specialist. I also provide customized 1-on-1 coaching sessions and teach other Google Ads specialists and
              agencies the intricacies of the business.</p>
